        <h2><abbr titel="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr></h2>
        <img src="/image/cli-image.png" width="300px" alt="Program lines">
        <p>A command-line-interface (CLI) proccesses commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text.In other words,it accepts user text input to execute operating function.</p>

        <h2>REPLit</h2>
        <p>Replit is a command line interface app.Everything in repl is done via CLI.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
             As in the first lecture,we have printed our name using the command <strong>console.log</strong>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The console. log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                In repl if we want to use user input we have to use "read-line-sync" which should be imported via syntax <strong>require('read-line-sync')</strong>.It will help to use the user input and use it according to the program.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each and every program works around one thing and that is input>>processing>>output.If you understand this it will be lot easier to understand how the programs works.
