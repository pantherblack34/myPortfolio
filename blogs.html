        <img src="/image/cli-image.png" width="300px" alt="Program lines">
        <p>A command-line-interface (CLI) proccesses commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text.In other words,it accepts user text input to execute operating function.</p>

        <h2>REPLit</h2>
        <p>Replit is a command line interface app.Everything in repl is done via CLI.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
             As in the first lecture,we have printed our name using the command <strong>console.log</strong>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The console. log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                In repl if we want to use user input we have to use "read-line-sync" which should be imported via syntax <strong>require('read-line-sync')</strong>.It will help to use the user input and use it according to the program.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each and every program works around one thing and that is input>>processing>>output.If you understand this it will be lot easier to understand how the programs works.

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <img src="/image/git.png" alt="Git image">
        <p>Git is an open source software which is used to track any changes done in the program.It is basically created for the coordination of work between the team with less effort.</p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                In the second lecture we focussed on the following softwares:

            </p>
            <li>
                index.html-This file contains the blueprint of website,how it should be made,what it should contain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Read.me-A README file contains information about the other files in a directory or archive of computer software. A form of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file called README.
            </li>
            <li>
                .gitignore-The . gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of your repo. / will ignore directories with the name.
            </li>
            <li>
                adding and removing-In github desktop,when anything is added it shows green color and when anything is removed it shows red color.So,this way you know what changes has been done in github.
            </li>
            <li>
                commit-A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.
            </li>
            <li>
                push-The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
            </li>
            <li>
                pull request-Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
            </li>
            <li>
                web hosting - Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files onto the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet has access to your website.This is where netlify comes into action

        <strong>HTML</strong>-The <abbr title="HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE">HTML</abbr> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript. It defines the meaning and structure of web.HTML are basically <strong>case-insensitive</strong>,but there are exception for entities such as <b>class</b>,<b>id</b> etc. <br>

        <img src="/image/css.jpg" alt="CSS image">

            <li>
                <h4>META TAGS</h4>Meta &nbsp&ltmeta&gt&nbsp tags are pieces of information you use to tell the search engines and those viewing your site more about your page and the information it contains.The meta tags don't appear on the page itself, but only in the page's source code. Meta tags are essentially little content descriptors that help tell search engines what a web page is about.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>TYPOGRAPHY</h4>

                <h4>LINKS</h4>The &nbsp&ltlink&gt&nbsp tag is used to define a link between a document and an external resource. The link tag is used to link to external style sheets. This element can appear multiple times but it goes only in the head section. The link element is empty, it contains attributes only.
            </li>
            <li>

        <h3>CSS Commonly used properties</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>COLOR</h4>The color property in CSS is used to set the color to text, the background of the webpage, and also to set the color of borders.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>FONT SIZE</h4>Font-size is the CSS property that controls the size of the font on a webpage. There are several different values you can use to define the font-size property. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>BACKGROUND COLOR</h4>The background-color property sets the background color of an element.The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>The background property in CSS allows you to control the background of any element.You can add color, image, gradients etc to beautify the file.

            <li>
                <h4>HEIGHT & WIDTH</h4>The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element. The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>MARGIN</h4>The margin property defines the space around an HTML element. It is possible to use negative values to overlap content.You can also set margin to a specified part.For ex-margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-right, margin-left.

            <li>
                <h4>BOX MODEL</h4>The CSS Box Model is used to create a definition for the way the HTML elements are organized on the screen. This approach accounts for options such as margins, padding, borders, and all the properties that manipulate them.Each element can be thought of as having its own box.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>BORDER</h4>The border property in CSS is used to style the border of an element. This property is a combination of three other properties border-width, border-style, and border-color.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>BORDER RADIUS</h4>The border-radius CSS property rounds the corners of an element's outer border edge. You can set a single radius to make circular corners, or two radii to make elliptical corners.

        <h2>VANILLA JS or JAVASCRIPT</h2>
        <img src="/image/JavaScript-Logo.jpg" alt="JAVASCRIPT LOGO" width="200px">
        The term vanilla script is used to refer to the pure JavaScript (or we can say plain JavaScript) without any type of additional library.JS is a dynamic programming language that supports Math calculations, allows you to dynamically add HTML contents to the DOM, creates dynamic style declarations, fetches contents from another website, add functionality to the website and lots more.There are many ways of using JS in clients but the most common and simple are`:
        <ol>
            <li>
                "<strong>alert</strong>" - The alert() method in JavaScript is used to display a virtual alert box. It is mostly used to give a warning message to the users. It displays an alert dialog box that consists of some specified message (which is optional) and an OK button.
            </li>
            <li>
                "<strong>prompt</strong>" - The prompt() method is used to display a dialog with an optional message prompting the user to input some text. It is often used if the user wants to input a value before entering a page. It returns a string containing the text entered by the user, or null. Syntax: prompt(message, default).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>console.log()</strong> - The console. log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user. Syntax: console. log("message");
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <p>The elements which I used in the assignment are defined below:</p>
            <li>
                <h4>BUTTON</h4>The button object in HTML is used to represent a &nbsp;&ltbutton&gt&nbsp; element. The getElementById() method is used to get the button object. Creating button object: The button object can be created using JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>addEventListener</h4>The addEventListener() is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired. Any number of event handlers can be added to a single element without overwriting existing event handlers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>CALL BACK FUNCTION</h4>The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method. It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter). With call() , an object can use a method belonging to another object.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>TEXTAREA</h4>The &nbsp;&lttextarea&gt&nbsp; tag defines a multi-line text input control.A text area can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the text renders in a fixed-width font (usually Courier). The size of a text area is specified by the &nbsp;&ltcols&gt&nbsp; and &nbsp;&ltrows&gt&nbsp; attributes (or with CSS).
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>querySelector()</h4> The querySelector() method only returns the first element that matches the specified selectors. To return all the matches, use the querySelectorAll() method instead.
            </li>       
          </ol>

        <h2>REACT.JS</h2>
        <img src="/image/reactjs.png" alt="REACT JS" width="200px">
        ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the application.The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>DECLARATIVE</strong> - A declarative style, like what react has, allows you to control flow and state in your application by saying <strong>"It should look like this"</strong> where as in an imperative style turns that around and allows you to control your application by saying <strong>"This is what you should do"</strong></li>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>COMPONENT BASED</strong> - Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but <strong>work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function</strong>. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Learn Once,Write Anywhere</strong> - This means you have to learn one stuff and even if you switch from one platform to another the concept of previous language is still able to use in that platform which will help you to learn, understand and debug the code with ease.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <p>In this lecture we are using <strong>CodeSandbox</strong>, which is an online code editor and prototyping tool that makes creating and sharing web apps faster.</p>
            <li>
                What I first encountered in codesandbox is that there are multiple folders which contain JSON files, than after viewing the video I understand how the <strong>REACT</strong> in <strong>CodeSandbox</strong> works.
            </li>
            <li>
                How the codesandbox works is that,there us a folder which contains styling part i.e,style.css which transforms the style in the file which contains app.js which in turn change the index.js which ultimately change the index.html via an <strong>id element "root"</strong>.In short, style.css >> app.js >> index.js >> index.html.
            </li>
            <li>
                to edit in html, you have to edit it in app.js which will reflect the changed element in index.html.This is called rendering.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to add style,you can add it in style.css whereas if you want to add style in app.js than you have to use an object to define the style in app.js.
            </li>
            <li>
                The naming convention in app.js is little bit different as compared to CSS,here it follows <strong>BEM</strong> naming convention.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are two different types of curly brackets {}:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Single Curly Bracket {function} - Which defines the function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Double Curly Brackets {{Object}} - which defines the style component object to be used.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>JSX</h3>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code). ... It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>{useState}</strong> - useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value and another function to update this value.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hooks</strong> - Hooks allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Arrow Function ()=>{code inside}</strong> - In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever. With arrow functions, the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

                To convert <strong>Objects{}</strong> into <strong>arrays[]</strong> - There are three ways to convert:
                <ul>
                    let object = {"name" : "kingkong", "power" : "smash"};
                    <li>
                        <b>Object.keys(object variable)</b> : By using key we get, only the key values.Ex:-Object.keys(object) we get ["name", "power"]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Object.values(object variable)</b> : By using key we get only pair values.Ex:- Object.values(object) we get ["kingkong", "smash"]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Object.entries()</b> : By using entries, we get both the key and pair values.Ex:- Object.entries(object) we get [["name", "kingkong"], ["power", "smash"]]
                    </li>
                </ul>
